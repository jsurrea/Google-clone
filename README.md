Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a responsive web UI for Google's search engine service. It is part of my learning path of Web Development and I hope it'll be useful to anyone looking to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. You're welcomed to contribute to this project! Open a Pull Request with new views or features and join me on this quest of learning and building software together ðŸ’ª
